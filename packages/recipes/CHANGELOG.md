# @wirecore/wirelayer-recipes

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b46176b: Avatar `as="button"`: the avatar as a button, e.g. the trigger of a user menu (`<Menu><Avatar as="button" name="…" />
  </Menu>`), with the focus ring of the other buttons and a ring on hover and while its menu is open (avatar recipe:
  variant `interactive` and slot `content`, `.wc-avatar-interactive`). The button is named by an image inside it that
  carries `name`, so the visible initials do not have to be part of an aria-label (WCAG 2.5.3 label in name). An explicit
  `aria-label` on an avatar that is not a button now wins over `name`.
- b46176b: Menu: `placement` (the values of Popover, default `bottom-start` as before), e.g. `bottom-end` for a user menu at the
  right edge, and `arrow` for an arrow at the trigger, styled like the Popover's (menu recipe: slots `arrow` and
  `arrowTip`).
- b46176b: Fix: `linkAs` works with routers that need `to` – vue-router's `RouterLink`, React Router and TanStack Router `Link`.
  Menu, ContextMenu and Menubar items, BottomNavigation items and the MegaMenu links take `to` (a path or a route object);
  the link component then gets `to` instead of `href`. Without `to` nothing changes (`href` for NuxtLink, Next.js Link
  or `<a>`). MegaMenu also has `moreTo` and `allTo` for its "Show all" links; `href` still identifies a link for
  `currentHref`. Recipes: `linkTarget(href, to)` and the type `LinkTo`.
- b46176b: PopoverContent: `hideTitle` keeps the title for screen readers only (it still names the panel) and `closable={false}`
  drops the close button, e.g. for an app switcher. Popover recipe: variant `hideTitle`. Fix (React): a PopoverContent
  without `description` no longer points `aria-describedby` at a description that does not exist.
- b46176b: One corner radius for all floating surfaces: the new token `--radius-popup` (12px, class `rounded-popup`) is used by
  Menu, ContextMenu, Menubar menus, the option lists of Select, MultiSelect, Combobox, Autocomplete, TagsInput, Mentions,
  CascadeSelect and TreeSelect, Popover, HoverCard, ConfirmPopup, Tour, DatePicker, ColorPicker, the DataTable filter
  panel, NavigationMenu, MegaMenu, FloatingPanel and the editor's bubble menu and mention list. Visible change: menus and
  option lists go from 10px to 12px (their items from 6px to 8px, so the corners stay concentric), the editor's menus
  from 8px to 12px; the panels already had 12px. Tooltip, Toast and Dialog keep their radius. A theme can set
  `--radius-popup` to change all of them at once.
- b46176b: Collection props take read-only arrays (`readonly T[]`), like Select already did: DataTable `data` and `columns`, the
  `items` of Menu, Tree, Steps, Breadcrumb, Timeline, Carousel and the other list components, chart `data` and `series`,
  Menubar `menus`, Scheduler `events` and many more – data from an API client no longer has to be copied. Props that are
  written back (`v-model:*` / `on…Change`, e.g. `modelValue`, `selectedValue`, Kanban `columns`) and the nested
  `children` of trees and column groups stay mutable. The recipe helpers that read such lists (Gantt, scheduler,
  notifications, `rankItems`, `filterMenuEntries`, `withLoadedChildren`, …) take read-only arrays as well.
- b46176b: New TopBar: a slim app header outside AppShell (`<header>`) with `start`, the middle (default slot / children, takes
  the free space) and `end` – without menus and without the toolbar's arrow-key navigation (recipe `topBar`,
  `.wc-top-bar`).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 9c4aa96: Fix: the sources files of `styles-core.css` brought the classes of all recipes with automatic source detection
  (`@import 'tailwindcss'`) – Tailwind scans the whole folder of a file that an `@source` in `node_modules` points to,
  and the class lists of all recipes were files in one folder. `sources/<recipe>.css` now contains the classes as
  `@source inline()`; the imports stay the same. Tailwind CSS 4.1 or newer is required (`@source inline()`, and
  `@source not`, which `styles.css` already used): the peer dependency is now `^4.1.0`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e0740a: Smaller CSS for apps that use only a few components (opt-in, `styles.css` is unchanged): `styles-core.css` brings the
  theme and the fonts without the classes of the components, which an app then imports per component it uses –
  `@wirecore/wirelayer-vue/sources/Button.css`, `@wirecore/wirelayer-blocks-vue/sources/SiteHeader.css` (also the
  React packages) – or per recipe it calls itself: `@wirecore/wirelayer-recipes/sources/card.css`. The file of a component
  brings the classes of the components it renders as well. A site with a header, buttons, cards and prose shrinks from
  about 184 kB (29 kB gzip) to 47 kB (10 kB gzip). In development the components warn when the classes of a recipe they
  render are missing (`checkRecipeSources` in the recipes).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 54609a3: DataTable: new prop `csvSeparator` for the CSV export, also for the built-in export button. By default the separator
  now follows the locale like a spreadsheet does (`csvSeparator(locale)` from the recipes): `;` where numbers have a
  decimal comma (de-DE, fr-FR …), `,` otherwise (en-US …). Before, it was always `;`. `exportCsv({ separator })` still
  wins over both.
- 54609a3: **Breaking:** German is a language module like French or Spanish and no longer part of the default bundle (about half
  of the built-in texts). Only English is built in. Apps that use German register it once at startup, before the first
  render:

    ```ts
    import { registerLocale } from '@wirecore/wirelayer-vue'; // or -react, -native
    import { de } from '@wirecore/wirelayer-vue/locales/de';

    registerLocale('de', de);
    ```

    `messages` only contains `en` now; the German texts are `de` from `…/locales/de`. The German names and search words of
    the EmojiPicker moved there as well (`emojiPicker.emojis`); the built-in emojis are English. `localeEmojis(texts)` no
    longer takes a locale – pass the lines of the language module (`localeEmojis(de.emojiPicker.emojis)`).

### Patch Changes

- 54609a3: Documentation says English is the default language, as it is in the code: `useLocale` and the MCP server/`llms.txt`
  no longer claim German without a `LocaleProvider`.
